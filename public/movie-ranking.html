       <h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
       <hr>
           <h3>Pearl Harbor</h3>
           <p>This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It mixes a fictional 
               love story with a true historical event. It will make you laugh. 
               It will make you cry.
           </p>
           <h3>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</h3>
           <p>
               Even though it is an old movie, it has always been one of my favorites!
           </p>
           <h3>The Little Mermaid</h3>
           <p>
               The original Disney movie, not the new one.
